include::./_includes/attributes.adoc[]

== Web Root

The Web Root is `src/main/resources/web`, this is where the Web Bundler will look for stuff to bundle and serve.

[#static]
== Static files

There are 2 ways to add static files (fonts, images, music, video, ...) to your app:
- Files in `src/main/resources/web/public/&#42;&#42;` will be served statically under http://localhost:8080/.
- Other files imported from scripts or styles will be bundled and processed by the configured loaders (see <<loaders>>) allowing different options (like embedding them as data-url).
- For convenience, everything under `/static` is excluded (marked as external) from the bundling by default. This allows to reference static files from scripts or styles without errors (e.g. `import '/static/foo.png';`).

[#html-templates]
== html templates rendering

The Web-Bundler is natively integrated with https://quarkus.io/guides/qute-reference[Qute Template Engine] to render html templates at build-time (this won't affect runtime). This way you may create SPA out of the box.  For this, just provide an `index.html` file (or any other `.html` file) in the `src/main/resources/web` directory.

Combined with the <<bundle-tag>>, this file will be rendered with the scripts and styles tags to include in your html template. This file will be served as the default index file (e.g. http://localhost:8080/).

NOTE: You can use the Qute `config:` https://quarkus.io/guides/qute-reference#config[namespace], it will be evaluated a build-time (runtime config will be ignored).

*Why is the directory different from other Qute app (i.e. `src/main/resources/templates/`)?*

When used in `src/main/resources/web` the rendering is happening at build time (and doesn't require Qute at runtime). It only offers partial support, so you won't be able to access any Qute runtime data in this file. If you want to render data (for example in a server-side rendering app with htmx), you should add the https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-qute-web[Qute Web] extension (or https://quarkiverse.github.io/quarkiverse-docs/quarkus-renarde/dev/[Renarde extension] for MVC with Qute) and use `src/main/resources/templates/` directory instead. The <<bundle-tag>> will also work with Quarkus Qute.

[#web-live-coding]
== Web Live-Coding

The Web Bundler enable browser live coding for development.

This is done through:
- a custom project sources watcher in Quarkus Dev
- a small injected https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-web-bundler/blob/main/deployment/src/main/resources/web-bundler/live-reload.js[script] (only in dev-mode). This script will listen for changes from the server.

In this mode when you change the sources, the page will automatically be:

- hot-reloaded (no refresh) when a style is modified (css, scss).
- refreshed when a js, template or java file is modified.

When web live coding is enabled, to allow it to work properly, minification and bundle hashes are disabled in dev-mode.

This can be disabled through xref:config-reference.adoc#quarkus-web-bundler_quarkus-web-bundler-browser-live-reload[browser-live-reload config].

NOTE: After a deployment/bundling error, you need to manually refresh the page to get back in live-reload mode.

== Bundling

By default, directory `src/main/resources/web/` is destined to contain the scripts, styles and possibly assets for your app. It will be bundled and served into `/static/bundle/app-[hash].[ext].` (see <<entry-points>> for more options).

[#importing-web-dependencies]
=== Importing Web Dependencies

Once added in the pom.xml, the web dependencies can be imported and used with the ESM import syntax, they will automatically be bundled.

WARNING: Web Dependencies (script and styles) need to be imported in order to be bundled, dead code will be eliminated during the build.

.web/script.js
[source,javascript]
----
import $ from 'jquery';
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';

$('.hello').innerText('Hello');
----

Styles can be also be imported from a scss file:

.web/style.scss
[source,scss]
----
@import "bootstrap/dist/scss/bootstrap.scss";
----

[#what-is-bundled]
=== What is bundled

[#indexing]
==== Indexing

*Only what's imported will be part of the resulting bundle*, to make it easy, the Web Bundler will automatically generate an index importing all the files found in an entry-point directory.

Of course, you can also provide this index manually (named `index.js,ts,jsx,tsx`) and choose what to import. Example:

.src/main/resources/web/index.js
[source,javascript]
----
import './my-script.js'
import './my-style.scss'
import './example.png'
----

[#entry-points]
==== Entry-Points

You may configure different entry-points (to generate different bundles):

.src/main/resources/application.properties
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.web-bundler.bundle.page-1=true // <1>
quarkus.web-bundler.bundle.page-2=true // <2>
----
<1> Bundle `src/main/resources/web/page-1/...` into `/static/bundle/page-1-[hash].[ext]`
<2> Bundle `src/main/resources/web/page-2/...` into `/static/bundle/page-2-[hash].[ext]`

or customize the directory name and bundled file name (and possibly merge multiple directories into one bundle):

.src/main/resources/application.properties
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.web-bundler.bundle.foo=true // <1>
quarkus.web-bundler.bundle.bar=true // <2>
quarkus.web-bundler.bundle.bar.key=my-key
quarkus.web-bundler.bundle.bar.dir=my-dir
quarkus.web-bundler.bundle.baz=true // <1>
quarkus.web-bundler.bundle.baz.key=foo

----
<1> Bundle `src/main/resources/web/foo/...` and `src/main/resources/web/baz/...` together into `/static/bundle/foo-[hash].[ext]`
<2> Bundle `src/main/resources/web/my-dir/...` into `/static/bundle/my-key-[hash].[ext]`

[IMPORTANT]
====
As soon as one or more entry-points are configured:
* Scripts and styles located at the root of the web directory will not be bundled. To keep things organized, move them to the web/app directory (or remove them if unnecessary).
* When multiple output entry points exist, shared code and web dependencies are extracted into a separate file which is auto-imported in `{#bundle /}`. This ensures that if a user navigates from one page to another, they don’t need to download all the JavaScript for the second page again—shared parts are already cached by the browser.
====


[#loaders]
=== How is it bundled (Loaders)

Bases on the files extensions, the Web Bundler will use xref:config-reference.adoc#quarkus-web-bundler_quarkus.web-bundler.bundling.loaders.js[pre-configured loaders] to bundle them. For scripts and styles, the default configuration should be enough.

For other assets (svg, gif, png, jpg, ttf, ...) imported from your scripts and styles using their relative path, you may choose the loader based on the file extension allowing different options (e.g. serving, embedding the file as data-url, binary, base64, ...). By default, they will automatically be copied and served using the xref:config-reference.adoc#quarkus-web-bundler_quarkus.web-bundler.bundling.loaders.file[file loader].

For example, `url('./example.png')` in a style or `import example from './example.png';` in a script will be processed, the file will be copied with a static name and the path will be replaced by the new file static path (e.g. `/static/bundle/assets/example-QH383.png`). The `example` variable will contain the public path to this file to be used in a component img `src` for example.

NOTE: For convenience, when using a file located in the static directory (e.g. `url('/static/example.png')`, the path will not be processed because all files under `/static/&#42;&#42;` are marked as external (to be ignored from the bundling). Since `/static/example.png` will be served by Quarkus (See <<static>>), it is ok.

=== SCSS, SASS

You can use scss or sass files out of the box. Local import are supported. Importing partials is also supported begin with `_` (as in `_code.scss` imported with `@import 'code';`).

[#web-dependencies]
== Web Dependencies

The Web Bundler is integrated with NPM dependencies through <<mvnpm>> (default) or <<webjars>>.
Once added in the pom.xml the dependencies are directly available through import from the scripts and styles.

Using the Web Bundler, Web Dependencies are bundled, there is not point for the jars to be packaged in the resulting app.
Web Dependencies with `provided` scope (or `compileOnly` with Gradle) will not be packaged in the resulting app.

INFO: By default, the Web Bundler will fail at build time if it detects non compile only Web Dependencies. You can configure xref:config-reference.adoc#quarkus-web-bundler_quarkus.web-bundler.dependencies.compile-only[a flag] to allow them but keep in mind that they will be served by Quarkus.

WARNING: If you don't import a Web Dependency from an entry-point (<<indexing>>), it won't be bundled (dead code elimination).


[#mvnpm]
=== MVNPM (default)

mvnpm (Maven NPM) is a maven repository facade on top of the NPM Registry.

Lookup for packages on https://mvnpm.org or https://www.npmjs.com/ then add them as web dependencies to your pom.xml:

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
...
<dependencies>
    ...
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.mvnpm</groupId> // <1>
        <artifactId>jquery</artifactId> // <2>
        <version>3.7.0</version> // <3>
        <scope>provided</scope> // <4>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
...
----

<1> use `org.mvnpm` or `org.mvnpm.at.something` for `@something/dep`
<2> All dependencies published on NPM are available
<3> Any https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery?activeTab=versions[published NPM version] for your dependency
<4> Use `provided` scope to avoid having the dependency packaged in the target application

If a package or a version in not yet available in Maven Central:

- You may use the mvnpm.org website to synchronize new versions with Maven Central (Click on the Maven Central icon)
- If configured with the mvnpm repository, when requesting a dependency, it will inspect the registry to see if it exists and if it does, convert it to a Maven dependency and publish it to Maven Central so that future developers (and CI) won't need the repository.

Configure the `mvnpm-repo` profile in your `~/.m2/settings.xml`:
.settings.xml
----
<settings>
    <profiles>
        <profile>
            <id>mvnpm-repo</id>
            <repositories>
                <repository>
                    <id>central</id>
                    <name>central</name>
                    <url>https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2</url>
                </repository>
                <repository>
                    <snapshots>
                        <enabled>false</enabled>
                    </snapshots>
                    <id>mvnpm.org</id> 
                    <name>mvnpm</name>
                    <url>https://repo.mvnpm.org/maven2</url>
                </repository>
            </repositories>
        </profile>
    </profiles>
</settings>
----

NOTE: I only use `-Pmvnpm-repo` when locking my project or updating mvnpm versions.

NOTE: In case of web dependencies versions conflicts, you can set the version to use for this dependency in the project dependencyManagement (even when using the locker).

[#browser-live-reload]
== Browser live-reload

Browser live reload is enabled by default:

- auto-inject a live-reload script in the bundle to watch for changes through sse (server-sent event)
- supersonic in-page replace for css/scss changes
- supersonic page refresh for javascript changes
- watch other Quarkus files such as html, java, ... (unless there is an error in which case a new request is needed)

This is enabled by default. To disable:
```properties
quarkus.web-bundler.browser-live-reload=false
```

When browser-live-reload is enabled:

- bundle files will be fixed (no hashes, i.e. `app.js`)
- minification is disabled


[#node_modules]
=== Node Modules for bundling

To deal with Web Dependencies, the Web Bundler manages a `node_modules` directory. The default location for it is the project directory. **Don't forget to add the `node_modules/` to the `.gitignore`**, the IDE will look recursively in parent directories for imports and the Web Bundler too.

[#locking]
=== Locking dependencies

As the NPM ecosystem is over-using version ranges for dependencies, just a few npm dependencies can lead to a big amount of poms to download in order to get the right versions for your project. This leads to long lasting minutes of downloading poms when cloning or during CI. To solve this problem and also to make your build reproducible it is highly recommended to lock your web dependencies versions. *This way it will be long only the first time and then it will be fast and reproducible.*

[#maven-locking]
==== Locking with Maven (mvnpm Locker Maven Plugin)

As Maven doesn't provide a native version locking system, the mvnpm team has implemented a way to easily generate and use a locking pom.xml (BOM). The locker Maven Plugin will create a version locker BOM for your org.mvnpm and org.webjars dependencies. It is essential as NPM dependencies are over using ranges. After the locking, the quantity of files to download is considerably reduced (better for reproducibility, contributors and CI).

It is easy to set up and update, https://github.com/mvnpm/locker#lock-your-mvnpm-and-webjars-versions[here is the documentation].

[#gradle-locking]
==== Locking with Gradle

Gradle provides a https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_locking.html[native version locking system], to install it, add this:

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
dependencyLocking {
    lockAllConfigurations()
}
----

Then run `gradle dependencies --write-locks` to generate the lockfile.

[#webjars]
=== WebJars

NOTE: Adding new dependencies or recent versions has to be done manually from their website.

WebJars are client-side web libraries (e.g. jQuery & Bootstrap) packaged into JAR (Java Archive) files. You can browse the repository from https://www.webjars.org/[the website, window="_blank"].

.pom.xml
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.webjars.npm</groupId>
    <artifactId>jquery</artifactId>
    <version>3.7.0</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
----

[#bundle-paths]
== Bundle Paths

After the bundling is done, the bundle files will be served by Quarkus under `{quarkus.http.root-path}/static/bundle/...` by default (xref:config-reference.adoc#quarkus-web-bundler_quarkus.web-bundler.bundle-path[Config Reference]).

This may also be configured with an external URL (e.g. 'https://my.cdn.org/'), in which case, Bundle files will NOT be served by Quarkus and all resolved paths in the bundle and mapping will automatically point to this url (a CDN for example).

In production, it is a good practise to have a hash inserted in the scripts and styles file names (E.g.: `app-XKHKUJNQ.js`) to differentiate builds (make them static). This way they can be cached without a risk of missing the most recent builds. This option is enabled by default in production.

To make it easy there are several ways to resolve the bundle files public paths from the templates and the code.

[#bundle-tag]
=== {#bundle /} tag

From any Qute template you can use the `{#bundle /}` tag to help insert the bundled scripts and styles in your html page. examples:

[source,html]
----
{#bundle /}
Output:
<script type="text/javascript" src="/static/bundle/app-[hash].js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen" href="/static/bundle/app-[hash].css">

{#bundle key="components"/}
Output:
<script type="text/javascript" src="/static/bundle/components-[hash].js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen" href="/static/bundle/components-[hash].css">

{#bundle tag="script"/}
Output:
<script type="text/javascript" src="/static/bundle/app-[hash].js"></script>

{#bundle tag="style"/}
Output:
<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen" href="/static/bundle/app-[hash].css">

{#bundle key="components" tag="script"/}
Output:
<script type="text/javascript" src="/static/bundle/components-[hash].js"></script>

----

=== Bundle Import Map

The `{#bundleImportMap /}` tag generates an import map that allows you to import modules directly from your bundled application within HTML `<script type="module">` blocks.

When used together with `{#bundle /}`, the `{#bundleImportMap /}` tag automatically creates an import map linking your bundle exports (e.g. 'app' -> `/static/bundle/app-3HNF28.js`) to the correct bundled file path which is changing on every build with a different hash.
This makes it possible to use ES module imports in HTML.

==== Example

.web/app.js
[source,javascript]
----
export const name = "import!";
----

.index.html
[source,html]
----
<html>
<head>

{#bundle /}
{#bundleImportMap /}

<script type="module">
  import { name } from 'app';
  alert(`Hello ${name}`);
</script>

</head>
</html>

----


=== Inject `Bundle` bean

This bean can be injected in the code:

[source,java]
----
@Inject
Bundle bundle;

...

System.out.println(bundle.script("app"));
System.out.println(bundle.style("app"));
----


or in a Qute template:
[source,html]
----
{inject:bundle.script("app")}
{inject:bundle.style("app")}
----
